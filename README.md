# SiderealAstroPy
Astrology functions that easily use either the tropical or sidereal zodiac. Written in Python 3.

Uses the pyswisseph library. You will need to both download the Swiss Ephemeris files and install pyswisseph. I use pipenv for dependency management and a virtual environment rolled into one.

When run, transits.py provides a simple command-line interface through which to interact with its functions.
